# Tennis-Tracker-Program-

Use Main.java to manipulate the list of tennis players shown in the rankings. You can choose to add players, remove players, print the list, find two players in common, record the result of a match between two players, or reset the season rankings. 

View Rankings.txt in order to view the ATP rankings, points on the season, and win percentage for each player.

Execute Bracket.java to run a simulation of a tournament. The top 16 players from the rankings will be taken into the tournament bracket, and the interactive software allows the user to record the winners of each matchup. After the conclusion of the tournament, the rankings will reflect the results and update the player rankings. The further a player goes into the tournament, the more points the player gets.
